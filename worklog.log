The math behind:

Bought 200 items for 10 per unit
Sold 50 items   (Inventory: 200 - 50 = 150  , per item price = 10) , Sold price = 50 * 10    = 500				    
Bought 250 items (Inventory = 150 + 250 = 400)
Sold 225 items (items from previous inventory = 150 (rate) , More needed = 75 ) Sold price = 150 * 10 + 75 * 15  = 2625, now 175 items remains now with a rate of 15 per item.
Buy 150 items : unit price 12.5 (Inventory = 175 + 150 = 325) 
Sell 50 items : we had 175 items from previous entry at a rate of 15 per item : 50 * 15 = 750

Calculation summary : 
50 * 10    = 500  
150 * 10 + 75 * 15  = 2625
50 * 15 = 750
                                             
500 + 2625 + 750 = 3875
